  <h2>Introduction </h2>
        <p>Prime numbers are very important in mathematics, especially in factoring. You should have already factored in and faced a question. Does this number have divisors? In this case, I created this program to solve this doubt. But for starters, what are prime numbers? </p> 
        
  <h2>What are Prime Numbers? </h2>
        <p>These are numbers that have only two divisors, being they <strong>one</strong> and <strong>Himself</strong>.There is only one even prime, that is 2. The rest are all divisible by 2. <br>
        The 7 first cousins are:  <em>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17.</em></p>

<h2>How does the program work? </h2>
        
<p>Come on, first there is an interactivity with the user. He adds a number and then the process starts. the variable <strong>HELP</strong> is created with the value 1. Then a sudden check is made if the rest of  <em>"help / num"</em> is remainder equal to 0. If it is, +1 point will be added to the variable  <strong>CONT</strong>. if in the end if <strong>CONT</strong> has 2 points the number is prime.</p>

<p>See how simple it is? It took me too long to create this system because it was a bit rusty from the programming. I've been trying to get back into that world, but I've been pretty busy. this was just a simple exercise to remember commands and logic. I appreciate your time. </p>
